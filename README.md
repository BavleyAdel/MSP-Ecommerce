# E-Commerce Website (React.js)

## Description
This project is a modern **E-Commerce Website** built using **React.js**, featuring dynamic price calculations, a shopping cart system, and an interactive UI.

- **Shopping Cart Management**: Add and remove products while updating the total price.
- **React JSX Implementation**: Utilizes JSX rules and logic for UI rendering.
- **Parent & Child Components**: Implements component hierarchy effectively.
- **Props & Callbacks**: Manages data flow between components using props and callback functions.
- **State Management**: Uses React state to update cart and price changes in real time.
- **Styled with CSS Modules**: Ensures modular and maintainable styles.

## Technologies Used
